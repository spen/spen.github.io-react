# SpenTaylor.com

This is a WIP rebuild of my personal website using React.  
It's around 90% done (In terms of a straight rebuild) so it's already live at [spentaylor.com](http://spentaylor.com/).

## Why the rebuild?
A couple of reasons.  
First: React.  
I just wanted to have a reasonable sized, non-todo-list project to really play around with React and some of it's surrounding libraries. 

Second: Take a look at the [original build](https://github.com/spen/spen.github.io-build).  
It had started to become a bit of a nightmare whenever I wanted to do anything remotely fancy such as page transitions.  
React & Redux seemed to solve many of these issues that I was seeing, particularly around managing state.

## Up & Running

Feel free to clone this proje	ct to play & tinker with it as you please :)
Here's how to get it running locally:

- Clone by running `git clone git@github.com:spen.github.io-react`
- Run `yarn install` (because it's 2016! ðŸŽ‰)
- Run `npm start` to bundle & serve the project.
- Finally, hit `http://localhost:3000/`in your browser ðŸ™‚

## Testing

You'll notice that there's no tests here currently!  
I'm a huge fan of testing generally but I've been eager to just build this out.  
That said - once this project is rounded out a little more I will be supporting it with unit tests - stay tuned!

## Still to come

Any to-dos will be tracked & kept (mostly) up to date in issue [#69](https://github.com/spen/spen.github.io-react/issues/69)
